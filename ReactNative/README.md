# 📱 Calorie Tracker - Mobile App (React Native)

This is the frontend of the Calorie Tracker application, built with **React Native** and **Expo**. It provides a smooth, native experience for tracking nutrition and physical progress, with a strong emphasis on performance and clean UI/UX.

---

## 🚀 Frontend Highlights

* **Optimistic UI Updates:** To ensure a lightning-fast feel, the app utilizes optimistic state updates. When adding or deleting logs, the UI reflects changes immediately before the server confirmation.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully adaptive layouts built with **NativeWind (Tailwind CSS)**, supporting both **Dark and Light modes** based on system preferences.
* **Interactive Data Visualization:** Custom-styled charts powered by `react-native-gifted-charts` to track weight trends and body measurements.
* **Smart Navigation:** Utilizes **Expo Router** for file-based routing, ensuring a clean and intuitive navigation flow.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Framework:** React Native (Expo)
* **Language:** TypeScript (Strictly typed)
* **Styling:** NativeWind (Tailwind CSS)
* **API Client:** Axios with custom Interceptors
* **State & Logic:** React Hooks
* **Charts:** React Native Gifted Charts
* **Icons:** Lucide React & Material Community Icons
* **Storage:** Expo SecureStore (for sensitive token management)

## 🏗 Network & Security Layer

One of the core features of the frontend is its robust communication with the FastAPI backend:

* **Axios Interceptors:** Automated handling of **Access & Refresh Tokens**. The app automatically attempts to refresh the session when a 401 error occurs, providing a seamless experience for the user.
* **Secure Storage:** JWT tokens are never stored in plain text; they are managed via **Expo SecureStore** for hardware-encrypted security.
* **Type Safety:** Shared interfaces between the backend and frontend ensure that all API responses are correctly typed and handled.

## 📝 Key Developer Features
* **Memoization:** Strategic use of useMemo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders in complex lists (like the "Fridge" or "Logs").

* **Clean Components:** Separation of business logic (Services/Hooks) from the presentation layer (Components).
