# 🧠 Calorie Tracker App

A personal health and nutrition app designed to help users track their calorie intake and meals. It includes a fridge feature where users can store individual products and complete meals, making it easy to calculate nutritional values later.

The app also allows users to log their body weight and measurements (such as neck, chest, waist, hips, etc.), helping them monitor progress over time in a structured and visual way.
